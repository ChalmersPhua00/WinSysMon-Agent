# WinSysMon-Agent
A CLI–based AI assistant for the Windows OS.

## Introduction
Instead of manually running PowerShell commands, checking Task Manager, users can simply ask the agent questions like "Why is my internet slow?", "Find large files in my Documents folder", or "What services are running at startup?". Powered by GPT-4o and built upon MCP, the agent intelligently selects and executes specific system tools to diagnose issues, monitor performance, and retrieve hardware details in real-time.

## Requirements
- Windows operating system  
- OpenAI API key  

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Simply double-click `winsysmon.bat` to start using.
